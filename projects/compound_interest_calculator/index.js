const prompt = require('prompt-sync')()
// Compound interest calculator that prompts a user for some inputs, and finally calculates the compounded interest value

let init_amount = 20000
let monthly_contribution = 400
let number_of_years = 30
let interest_rate = 10



// step 1 - define a function that we can use to calculate the final value of the compounded interest
function compoundInterest(init_amount, monthly_contribution, number_of_years, interest_rate){
    
}


// step 2 - define a function that would calculate the difference (ie the effect that compounding has had)


// step 3 - to create a run function that then prompts the user for all necessary inputs required to calculate the final amounts



// step 4 - inside of said function, make a nice pretty print statement using a template literal string that gives the financial breakdown
