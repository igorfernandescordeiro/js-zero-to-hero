// 1. Unique Characters in a String
// Question: Write a function to determine if a string has all unique characters. Return true if all characters are unique, and false otherwise. Assume the string only contains lowercase letters.



// 2. Merge Sorted Arrays
// Question: Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2, write a function to merge them into a single, sorted array.




// 3. Find All Duplicates in an Array
// Question: Given an array of integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n (n = size of the array), some elements appear twice and others appear once. Write a function that returns an array of all the elements that appear twice in the given array. You must achieve this with O(n) time complexity.



// 4. Rotate Array
// Question: Rotate an array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative. 



// 5. Valid Parentheses
// Question: Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid. An input string is valid if:
