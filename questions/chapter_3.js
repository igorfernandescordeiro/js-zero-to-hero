// 1. Array Filtering: Write a function that filters out all the even numbers from an array of integers.



//  2. Object Manipulation: Given an array of objects representing people with names and ages, write a function to find the person with the highest age.



// 3. Data Transformation: Convert an array of strings containing numbers into an array of actual number values.


// 4. Array Sorting: Write a function that sorts an array of objects based on a specific property (e.g., 'price') in ascending order.



// 5. Array Manipulation: Write a function that removes the first and last elements from an array and returns the modified array.



// 6. Object Iteration: Given an object representing a shopping cart with items and their quantities, write a function that calculates the total cost of the items.



// 7. Object Manipulation: Write a function that deep clones an object (i.e., copies all nested objects and arrays) to prevent unintended mutations.



// 8. Object Iteration: Given an object representing a student's grades in various subjects, calculate their average grade.



// 9. Scope and Closure: Create a function that returns a new function. The returned function should remember and log the number of times it's been called.
